Donate
~~~~~~

Although the software is for free (and Open Source), the development is notâ€¦

We are research-focused and not a commercial company (which we do not want to
become). So, if you want to contribute, consider donating some money via our
`crowdfunding platform
<https://steun.uu.nl/project/help-us-to-make-covid-19-research-accessible-to-everyone>`_
(even small donations are highly appreciated).

Another option is to include budget for ASReview in your grant proposal ;-)
