The Zen of Elas
===============

Elas is our Electronic Learning Assistant who will guide humans through the interactive process 
of making decisions using Artificial Intelligence in ASReview. Elas comes with some important 
viewpoints we would like to share with you. Note ASReview is a generic tool for the screening 
of any type of text [hyperlink naar info over data], but we often use the case of 
systematic reviewing to illustrate its usefulness.


**Humans are the Oracle**
It’s the interaction between humans and machines which will take science a major leap forward. 
We believe a human should make the final decision about whether to mark a record as 
relevant/irrelevant (hence, is the Oracle) and the software merely orders the records on 
the relevance score as predicted by the model in each iteration of the active learning cycle [ref naar nieuwe guide]. 


**Open & Transparent**
We are strong opponents of open science and therefore all our code is stored 
in the cloud (hyperlink to Github), but your data isn’t. We value your privacy 
and hence do not get to see any of your data (everyhing happens on your laptop). 
We do hope you believe like us in the FAIR data principles and publish your data, 
results and the technical logfiles [hyperlink naar RtD over export files] on a data repository. 


**Unbiasedness** 
We signed the DORA-declaration (https://sfdora.org) and we only present text for unbiased 
decision making. So, when screening for example academic papers we only show titles and abstracts, 
and we do not present authors, or journal names. This way, you can focus on what is truly important 
(the content) and don’t get tempted to use irrelevant information. 


**AI-aided Interface**
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication (Davinci) and  therefore we keep the front-end as 
clean as possible. Boring, but efficient because the magic with AI happens under the hood.


**Garbage in garbage out**
We focus on the machine learning part of the pipeline and not on the pre- or post processing 
of the data (which reference managers are designed for). Be aware of the principle GIGO and 
don’t blame Elas if the performance is not as good as expected (and first check the quality 
of your data [hyperlink to blogpost]).
