Simulation Mode
================

When using the :ref:`ASReview command line interface for simulation
<API/cli:Simulate>`, an additional binary variable to indicate labeling
decisions (``0`` = irrelevant, ``1`` = relevant) is required for ALL records
and can be used for running :doc:`simuation studies
<../guides/simulation_study_results>` via the :doc:`command line interface
<../API/cli>`.
