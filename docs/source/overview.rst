Overview

LOOSELY BASED ON README ON GITHUB

ASReview is a project to accelerate the process of systematic reviewing.
It is written in Python, and uses deep learning to predict which papers should be
most likely included in the review. Our software is designed to accelerate the step
of screening abstracts and titles with a minimum of papers to be read by a
human with no or very few false negatives.

ASReview software consists of a user friendly front-end (ASReview LAB) and a
powerful command line interface. The command line interface is to measure the
performance of the active learning models on the results of fully labeled
systematic reviews.

The source code is freely available at
`GitHub <https://github.com/asreview/asreview>`_.
