If a column with Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) is available in the meta-data
of your dataset, ASReview Lab will display the DOI with hyperlink during
screening. Most of the time, DOIs point to the full-text of a publication. See
:doc:`../datasets` for more information on including DOI values to your
datasets.
