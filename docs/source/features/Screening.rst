If a column with Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) is available in the meta-data
of your dataset, ASReview Lab will display the DOI with hyperlink during
screening. Most of the time, DOIs point to the full-text of a publication. See
:doc:`datasets <../intro/datasets>` for more information on including DOI values to your
datasets.

Keyboard shortcuts

ASReview LAB supports keyboard shortcuts. By default, keyboard shortcuts are
disabled. Enable the shortcuts as follows:

1. Open ASReview LAB.
2. Click on the settings icon (top right).
3. Check the **keyboard settings** field.

The table below lists the available keyboard shortcuts.

+-----------------------------+------------------------+

+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| Label record as irrelevant  | **i** or **Shift + i** |
+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| Return to previous decision | **u** or **Shift + u** |
+-----------------------------+------------------------+

.. note::

	Return to previous decision, **u** or **Shift + u**, is only available
	if the **Undo** feature has been toggled on in the settings panel.

1. Open ASReview LAB.
2. Open or create a project.
3. Label the record displayed in the screen as relevant or irrelevant.
4. Click on **Undo** (See picture below).
